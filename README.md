# MyMathCalc
#### This is the development of a math calculator app for android as part of a MOBI DEV course assignment. Although the final app was enough to meet the assignment requirements, it is planned to improve it.
##### This calculator is developed to produce each operation one at a time.

##### To the best use of the calculator, the user should keep the operations as like Number / Operator / Number / … / Equals
##### If the user wants to use a decimal number between 0 and 1, use zero before the decimal operator.

#### Improvements:

•	After using an operator (+ - / *), if the next button pressed is not a number, the calculator should not change its state.

•	Implementing the possibility of a number starting with the decimal operator and the finished math calculation.
